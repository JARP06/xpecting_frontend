  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <div class="resource-card">
    <h4>First Prenatal Visit</h4>
    <p>Schedule your first prenatal visit as soon as you have a positive home pregnancy test. Good prenatal care is crucial for a healthy pregnancy and baby. The first appointment usually occurs between weeks 6 and 8. Start acting pregnant immediately, such as taking a prenatal vitamin and following a healthy diet. If you suspect a high-risk pregnancy, check with your practitioner for an earlier appointment.</p>

    <h4>Preparing for Your First Pregnancy Appointment</h4>
    <p>Before your first prenatal appointment, prepare by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make a list of key health facts, including personal medical history, mental health history, gynecological history, obstetrical history, and potential disease exposure.</li>
      <li>Take stock of your medicine cabinet and note any medications and supplements you take.</li>
      <li>Find out about health conditions that run in your and your partnerâ€™s families.</li>
      <li>Jot down your questions to ensure you cover all your concerns during the appointment.</li>
    </ul>
