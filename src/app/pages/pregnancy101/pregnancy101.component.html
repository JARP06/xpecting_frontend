  <h2>First Trimester (0-13 Weeks):</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>During the first trimester, your baby's body structures and organs begin to form. It's a crucial period for development.</li>
    <li>Common symptoms include nausea (often referred to as morning sickness), fatigue, breast tenderness, and frequent urination.</li>
    <li>Your uterus expands to accommodate the growing embryo.</li>
    <li>Around 8 weeks, the baby's heartbeat can be detected.</li>
    <li>By the end of the first trimester, the baby is about 3 inches long.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="trimester">
  <h2>Second Trimester (14-26 Weeks):</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Often called the "honeymoon period," the second trimester brings relief from some early pregnancy discomforts.</li>
    <li>You may experience increased energy levels and improved sleep quality.</li>
    <li>An ultrasound around 18-20 weeks can reveal the baby's gender.</li>
    <li>Somewhere between 16-20 weeks, you'll feel the baby's first movements (quickening).</li>
    <li>The baby's organs continue to develop, and the skeleton becomes more defined.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="trimester">
  <h2>Third Trimester (27-40 Weeks):</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>As you approach the final weeks, anticipation for your baby's arrival grows.</li>
    <li>Physical discomforts may include shortness of breath, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, and sleep disturbances.</li>
    <li>The baby's bones are fully formed, and touch receptors are developed.</li>
    <li>The uterus expands significantly, reaching about 2.5 pounds at birth.</li>
    <li>The baby often settles into a head-down position in preparation for delivery.</li>
  </ul>
